.rds files are provided for everything except the shape data for the map; the file is too large for GitHub. That data was originally obtained from Census.gov (link: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html)  but that link is no longer functional.

The 'Shapefile Zip File' (tl_2019_us_zcta510.zip) provided on this site likely contains the same files, but the .zip download was not completing properly for me on 3/28/2020 so I was unable to verfify: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2019-2010-nation-u-s-2010-census-5-digit-zip-code-tabulation-area-zcta5-na 

^ As an alternative, the original shape files I downloaded are also available here on my Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v1dH4p_93VrOo8pGj2MZukbxdRK5hRDA?usp=sharing
